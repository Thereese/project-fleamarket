# Final Project - Find a Fleamarket

My final project on the Technigo bootcamp. A React-webapp for users to search for fleamarkets and to add their own.
I used Google Maps Api for the map, the library Places and Place Autocomplete for the searchbox.
The backend is built with Express and MongoDB.
To be able to add a flea market you need to be signed in, for that I used authentication and stored the token in cookies.

To start the project:
frontend - npm start
backend - npm run dev
